# Olympics Micro API

I wanted a simple way to grab the current medal count in JSON, so wrote this, and deployed it to http://olympics.clearlytech.com/ .  Find the API documentation hosted at http://olympics.clearlytech.com/api-doc.html

## Framework

Written using the [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com/) Ruby framework.

## Scraping

Scraping is being performed by the clever [Kimono](http://www.kimonolabs.com/) structured page extraction tool.

## Documentation

Created by [aglio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio) from an [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org/)

## Database, Caching, Queueing

Nope.
